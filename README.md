## 2. <a name='Installation'></a>Installation

Before starting project installation, You will need to launch the redis server provided by the docker-compose-redis.yml file :
In the docker/ folder, run:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up -d
```

To install the required dependencies, run the following command in the root directory of your project:

```
yarn install
```

Running in Development Mode:

```
yarn common
yarn server
yarn client
```

Build project for production

```
# Build for production
yarn common build
yarn client build
yarn server build

# Running prod mode
yarn start
```

## 3. <a name='AboutFutureSight'></a> üòé About FutureSight

FutureSight is web application allowing to generate dashboards for model comparison. The application is using [ECEMF](https://data.ece.iiasa.ac.at/ecemf/#/workspaces) public database, hosted by ECEMF partner [IIASA](https://iiasa.ac.at/). Users of the FutureSight application will be able to select and filter data prior to creating the visualization.
A number of features are accessible:

- Possibility to create a new dashboard
- Possibility to create a new dashboard from an existing one
- A list of the latest dashboards created in the app to provide potential ideas to new users
- Possibility to search for published dashboard in the database

Creating and configuring dashboards provides a wide selection of features. The first dashboard setup is configuring the metadata by selecting scenarios, models, variables, and regions. This metadata will be used to create visualization data blocks. The user can then select and filter the data that will be used within these data blocks.
The dashboard configuration panel can be used to add visualization blocks to the dashboard. Three types of visualization blocks are available:

- **Data block**: A block that displays data as a graph (line, bar, pie, map, box) or table
- **Text block**: A block that displays text
- **Control block**: A block that displays a UI to control the display data of other charts

[packages/](./packages/)

1. [client/](./packages/client/)
   A workspace that includes all UIs of FutureSight webapp, including home page, about page, browse page, and dashboard component. The main classes for implementing Dashboard component are:

   - [DashboardSelectionControl](./packages/client/src/components/dashboard/DashboardSelectionControl.tsx): Responsible for managing all selections on the dashboard, particularly handling state changes when block selections are modified, and it also manages the addition or removal of blocks from the dashboard.
   - [DashboardDataConfiguration](./packages/client/src/components/dashboard/DashboardDataConfiguration.tsx): Responsible for both retrieving data and sending the necessary data to each block.
   - [DashboardView](./packages/client/src/components/dashboard/DashboardView.tsx): Responsible for invoking Dashboard component.

2. [server/](./packages/server/)
   This workspace contains a Node.js Express web application where you'll find the code that interacts with the IIASA API and the Redis database. The main classes include:

   - [RedisPersistenceManager](./packages/server/src/redis/RedisPersistenceManager.ts): Responsible for handling all requests to the Redis database, including adding new dashboards, retrieving all published dashboards, and searching for a specific dashboard.
   - [IIASADataBackend](./packages/server/src/data_backend/IIASADataBackend.ts): Responsible for handling all requests to the IIASA API to retrieve filtered data.

3. [common/](./packages/common/)
   A workspace that includes common logic to be imported from other workspaces (client and server). Common includes all the code of dashboard, and it exports the Dashboard component, making it accessible for use by other workspaces or applications. The main classes in this workspace include:
   - [Dashboard](./packages/common/src/dashboard/Dashboard.tsx): The dashboard component is responsible for initiating a dashboard or publishing it.
   - [DashboardConfigView](./packages/common/src/dashboard/DashboardConfigView.tsx): Responsible for managing the dashboard grid layout.
